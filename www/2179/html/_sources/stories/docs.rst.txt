Documentation
=============
*As a command line user I want to have all essential documentation at hand.*

.. _/stories/docs/examples:

examples
^^^^^^^^


*As a new user I would like to experiment with the tool.*


A couple of instructive examples should be included in the package for easy first experimenting. Examples should be stored under the ``/usr/share/doc`` directory.

**Examples:**


.. code-block:: yaml

   cd /usr/share/doc/tmt/examples
   ls
   cd mini
   tmt test ls
   tmt plan ls
   tmt run


Status: implemented and verified

.. _/stories/docs/guide:

guide
^^^^^


*As a user migrating from old tools I want to quickly learn how to achieve my common daily tasks with the new tooling.*

.. note:: This is a draft, the story is not implemented yet.

Provide a Quick Start Guide describing the most common scenarios and showing mapping of old command to the new syntax.

**Examples:**


.. code-block:: yaml

   How do I do '1minutetip fedora' with tmt?



.. code-block:: yaml

   How do I do 'wow --reserve' with tmt?



.. code-block:: yaml

   How do I do 'make run' with tmt?


Status: idea

.. _/stories/docs/help:

help
^^^^


*As a command line user I want to quickly check all available options and supported commands.*


All available options should be easily discoverable directly from the command line using the ``--help`` option.

**Examples:**


.. code-block:: yaml

   tmt --help



.. code-block:: yaml

   tmt run --help



.. code-block:: yaml

   tmt test import --help


Status: implemented and verified

.. _/stories/docs/man:

man
^^^


*As a command line user I want to check the man page to get a basic overview about the tool.*


There should be a manual page availabe in the package. Man page should contain brief introduction about the tool and a list of essential commands and options.

**Examples:**


.. code-block:: yaml

   man tmt
